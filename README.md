# PlaqueIt

This Android app is built for my Computer Science course at Brunel University, for module CS2001. The spec briefed us that it had to include 2 features - the user's location had to be trakced and used (e.g nearby friends or locations) and there had to be some sort of "treasure hunt" element. With this in mind, we came up with an idea to show the user [Blue Plaques](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0007-remove-c-style-for-loops.md) that are nearby. Blue Plaques are mainly situated around London and are on Historically significant buildings and monuments; for example, "X, who invented the Y, lived here from XXXX - YYYY". We will suggest plaques that are close to the user's location and show the user a list of these, and also allow them to see a map of the plaques. We will give the user directions to these plaques (walking, driving and public transport). We will award the user points and potentially trophies for the plaques they visit. Ideally, the more significant the plaque, the more points the user will get.

## Stretch Goals
- Allow the user to select a "theme" for the plaques. The app will then show them a few plaques that are close by to the user's location, for example "Victorian London".
- Make the app social; allow the user to see which plaques their friends have visited and how many points they have.
